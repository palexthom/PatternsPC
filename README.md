# Design Patterns with PyCharm

I've read the Head First Design Pattern book, which gives numerous examples of design patterns in JAVA.  

I've implemented some of these patterns as Jupyter Notebooks, as it allows me to include images and a lot of comments (see dedicated project https://github.com/palexthom/Patterns), but also wanted to learn how to use a proper development environment so I also did some of these pattern implementation exercises with PyCharm. This repository is where those exercises are stored.
